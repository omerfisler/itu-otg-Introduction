    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all your ingredients.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons
                parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about
                1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
                minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon
                salt.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
                lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
                with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
                sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.

            </p>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Recommended</strong> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.

            </p>
