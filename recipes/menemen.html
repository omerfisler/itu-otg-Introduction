    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Menemen is a popular traditional Turkish dish that includes eggs, tomato, green peppers, and spices such as
        ground black and red pepper cooked in olive oil. You can find a detailed ingredient
        list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons of oil
        </li>
        <li>3 green peppers (after removing the stems and seeds, finely chopped)
        </li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>1/2 (half) teaspoon of salt
        </li>
        <li>3 eggs
        </li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> half a small bowl of cheddar cheese would be enough.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Add oil and peppers to the pan and fry until the peppers change color.

        <li>Add peeled and finely chopped tomatoes.

        <li>Cover the pan on low heat and wait for the tomatoes to cook thoroughly.

        <li>If the tomatoes are sticking to the pan, you can add a little boiling water. This usually won't be
            necessary.

        <li>Once the tomatoes are cooked, you can break the eggs in, as shown in the photo. You can either whisk the
            eggs in a separate bowl and add them, or, like I did, break them into the pan and stir them in.

        <li>Add salt and any spices you like and wait until the eggs are cooked.

        <li>If you'd like to add cheddar cheese, you can do so at this stage. Serve the menemen hot.
